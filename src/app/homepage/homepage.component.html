		<div class='para'>
			According to the National Geographic1, "Bottled water is a drain on the environment: The U.S. public goes through about
			50 billion water bottles a year, and most of those plastic containers are not recycled. Transporting the bottles and keeping
			them cold also burns fossil fuels, which give off greenhouse gases." 1500 plastic bottles are consumed every second. Enough plastic
			is thrown away each year to circle the earth four times. And, it will take 1000 years for the plastic to degrade.
		</div>
		<div class="para-header-2">It can pose health threats</div>
		<div class='para'>
			The plastic in bottled water often contains chemicals BPA and phthalates, which are proven to be hazardous to human health.
		</div>
		<div class="para-header-2">It's not proven to be any safer than tap water</div>
		<div class='para'>
			The non-profit, non-partisan Environmental Working Group (EWG) says, "The government does not mandate that bottled water be
			any safer than tap water. In fact, the chemical pollution standards are nearly identical." Historically, bottled waters have
			even been recalled for contamination with particulate matter, mold and bacteria.
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="right-col">
		<div class="para">
			Further, as reported by ABC, environmental advocate Mae Wu has performed studies which show bottled is no safer
			or cleaner: There is actually more testing federally mandated on tap water than bottled. 100 compounds of tap water must be tested
			every day and the results posted online.
		</div>
		<div class="para-header-2">It doesn't necessarily taste better</div>
		<div class="para">
			In this video by ABC, in a blind taste test, many even preferred the taste of tap water over bottled.

			Safe and readily available water is a basic human necessity in order to meet health and sanitation needs.

			<ul>
				<li>Around the world, at least 1.8 billion people utilize a drinking water source contaminated with fecal matter.</li>

				<li>By 2025, half of the world's population will be living in water-stressed areas.</li>
				<li>In low and middle income countries, 38% of health care facilities lack any water source, 19% do not have improved sanitation, and 35% lack water and soap for handwashing.</li>

			We're not trying to say that our Enagic® machine will solve all of the world's water problems. However, we do advise

		<div class="para">
			Thirty-five years after the U.S. Congress passed the Safe Drinking Water Act, some regulators and environmentalists
			state the law is now so obsolete that it fails to protect people from the most obvious threats.
		</div>
		<div class="para">
			In the USA, the NY Times reported on violations of the Clean Water Act, a federal law which governs water pollution,
			and has shown household water that is contaminated with lead, nickel, and other heavy metals. (Some extreme side-effects
			of this contamination have resulted in skin burns, rashes, and eroded tooth enamel).
		</div>
		<div class="para">
			The NY Times has since compiled a database of violations of the Safe Drinking Water Act, finding 40% of the nation's
			community water systems in violation at least once, exposing millions to potentially harmful chemicals, toxins, and heavy metals.
