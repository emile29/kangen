The first time I tried Kangen, I was preparing to write an exam for a professional certification. Three days later, I realized that I didn't have any headache even if I was sleeping only for 4 to 5 hours. Also, I was easily drinking 2 to 3 liters a day, which was almost impossible. I can feel the benefit of Kangen water.",
